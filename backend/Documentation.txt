-->In early days  js was used to  frontend only as scription language for the browser.
-->In this period the js was not supported in the server, so python, Java ,php etc were used as backend.


-->Later on the concept of nodejs was introduced as a runtime for the js on the server side.
-->Now the runtime (nodejs) is responsibe for executing the js code on the server side.

-->Node js (Library) is the runtime prototype of (protocal) which is complex and  has a lot of features.
-->Then Express js was introduced as the framework insted of core nodejs.

2.npm init -y
3. npm i express

5."type":"module" add this in package json
6.npm i nodemon -->keeps the server running (nodemon server.js)
